## Greetings!  

Hey, I'm **Adam**! I'm a young developer with a deep passion for anything open-source, impactful, or just plain interesting. If you wish to contact me, shoot me an email at `GithubContact@AdamT05.com`!

## Specialisations  

I have a number of years in IT, mostly with Linux system administration. Most of my open-source projects have a public instance hosted by myself on my own 4-node HA-cluster homelab.  

On the developer side, I have considerable experience with backend development in **Node.js, JavaScript/TypeScript, and Python**. I'm not generally a front-end guy - I cannot make a decent-looking UI for the life of me — however, I am experienced with **React and its surrounding frameworks**.  

I lean towards **Docker** deployments for most projects that I host, as it integrates well with my **CI/CD pipeline**, and the reproducability aspect is a nice-to-have.  

I'm currently learning **Rust** and expect to start releasing **Rust-based projects** around the end of 2025.
